### Favorite CPSC 120L Labs

* Lab 1
This was a very fun lab for me because it was my first time ever learning how to program. It taught me many of the useful things I needed to know in order to do future assignments. This lab will always be one of my favorite moments in CPSC120L.

* Lab 5, part 2
Although this lab was not quite as fun as the other labs, I put this on my list because of how difficult it was. Me and my partner had a tough time with this lab. It just seemed like we typed a lot.

* Lab 12, part 1
Even though this was the most recent lab, I decided to put this one on my list because it was pretty fun. One of the things that stood out to me during this lab was that we got to make a gif. I have always wanted to make a gif and I actually did it.
